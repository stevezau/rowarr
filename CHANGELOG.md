## [0.1.0-beta] - 2026-07-21

First public beta. Everything below ships in this release.

### Personalized rows

- **Engine** — the full nightly pipeline per user: watch history (Tautulli, with a per-user
  fallback to Plex's own history; episodes de-duplicated to distinct shows) → candidate sources →
  heuristic ranking → optional LLM curation → per-user collection delivery → merge-only
  share-filter privacy sync with snapshots.
- **Candidate sources** — TMDB similar, TMDB discover-by-taste, Trakt related titles, "AI suggests
  from your library", and **AI web search** for current/well-reviewed titles (via the curator's own
  web search or an Exa key — the latter also gives a local Ollama model web search).
- **Optional AI curator** — Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / Ollama, with a fetched model picker; or
  **None** (heuristic mode), the default. The curator only ever picks from titles verified to exist
  in your library, and writes the one-line "Because you watched X" reason.
- **Multiple rows + shared rows** — several rows per person and server-wide shared rows, each with
  its own sources, size, libraries, curation style/prompt, audience, schedule, placement, and
  poster.
- **Freshness as a cadence** — rows stay stable and refresh every N days (nightly → fortnightly),
  so a person's row isn't reshuffled every night; unchanged rows skip the Plex write entirely.
- **Row placement** — choose the Plex shelf (Home / library Recommended / both) and position, per
  row; coexists with other shelf-ordering tools.
- **Custom / AI row posters** — upload artwork or generate it from text (with `{user}` /
  `{library_name}` placeholders), reusing your AI key; cached across runs.

### Privacy & safety

- **Leak-safe row privacy** — each row is labelled `shortlist_<userslug>`; a
  `label!=shortlist_<userslug>` exclusion is merged (read-modify-write, never rebuilt) into every
  other account's share filter. Rows are swept/delivered **unpromoted**, exclusions merged, and only
  then promoted — a row is never visible before the exclusion that hides it exists.
- **Provable uninstall** — restores every user's share filters from the snapshot taken before the
  first restriction write, and deletes only `shortlist_*`-labelled collections; dry-run preview.
- **Safe mode** — `SHORTLIST_DRY_RUN=1` forces every run to dry-run (writes nothing to Plex) — try
  it against a real server first.
- **Secrets** — Plex tokens and LLM/API keys encrypted at rest (Fernet), redacted in the UI, never
  logged.

### App

- **Web app** — FastAPI backend (SQLite, APScheduler, SSE) + React SPA: an impact dashboard
  (delivered vs actually-watched hit rate), users, rows, live run activity, requests inbox, and a
  first-run onboarding wizard. Programmatic API token for automation.
- **Login with Plex** — PIN flow, owner-only sessions, CSRF-protected mutations.
- **Requests** — an approval inbox for wanted-but-missing titles, optionally auto-sent to
  Sonarr/Radarr, with a choice of rating source (TMDB, or IMDb/RT/Metacritic/Trakt via MDBList).
  Each entry shows which person and row wanted it and why; a **Sent** log records what went out.
  Rejected titles are never re-queued.
- **Packaging** — multi-arch Docker image (GHCR), compose example, Unraid template, healthcheck,
  PUID/PGID, configurable PMS timeout (`plex.timeout_s`).

### Notes

- The label-based share exclusions require PMS **≥ 1.43.2.10687** (older builds ignore the
  exclusion). The setup wizard shows the server version but never blocks a run over it.
- Collections without a `shortlist_*` label are never modified or deleted (Kometa coexistence).
- Plex cannot hide collections from the **server owner** — the owner's own Home shows every row.
